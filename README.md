# Tap Room

#### _Tap Room on React, 06/29/18_

#### By _**Eva Antipina**_

## Description
A small React app for a bar to track their kegs.
There is React app's component structure in the project file TapRoomComponentStructure.jpg (./src/assets/images/TapRoomComponentStructure.jpg).

## User story:

* As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent.

* As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (A full keg has roughly 124 pints).

* As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list.

## Future user story:

* As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.

* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.

* As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.

* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability.

* As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
